Step 3 - Make phishing website that looks like organizational login <br>
Step 4 - Mail everyone and get results <br>

# Steps undertaken
Send a mail to the info section of my campus, asking them for a mailing list to use for an inquiry!
Got a response, they can't send me the e-mails due to GDPR, damn!
Created a near carbon copy of the desktop version of the login page, need to think about mobile version later down the line.
